# algos
(basics, not 100% self made im not that smart lmao, do not trust)

there are all basic algos, not optimized at all: not neutral positions i.e. always in a trade (UPDATE: there are now algos with neutral pos), percentiles in mean revert algo aren't 100% correct (not even close), ma choose for quant or mean revert maybe aren't good, etc

also all are using the binance api to import data; to run the code/algo for another coin just change
the pair (ETHUSDT, LTCUSDT, etc) or use another exchange

and do not trust the results

hope this help c:
