# algos
(basics, do not trust)

there are all basic algos, not optimized at all (like not neutral positions i.e. always in a trade, etc)

also all are using the binance api to import data; to run the code/algo for another coin just change
the pair (ETHUSDT, LTCUSDT, etc) or use another exchange

i still haven't learned how to plot candlestick charts

and do not trust the results lmao

i dont remember from where i saw the algos implementation but surely is somewhere in youtube
